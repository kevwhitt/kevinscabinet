				<h2>Target Audience</h2>
					
				<p>From what I could see, their target audience was young, stylish Americans who like special styles and designs of shoes. The site showed their special products on their homepage, but other than that, everything could be found easily with a sidebar navigation. That made it easy to find what you were looking for without having being distracted or lost. The site was simple; that made it enjoyable. The colors were soft and the content wasn't flying out at your face. I feel it was good for mobile viewing. The site didn't not feel overwhelming with links and pictures, but rather it was simple. There were advertisements to their new releases and such, but they were clean and simple. </p>

				<h2>Site Contrast</h2>
				<p>To be completely honest, I didn't find any sites that I didn't really like. Even when using exclusively my phone, I don't browse the internet. I know I was supposed to keep track of the sites I saw, but I didn't see any. I don't have anything to compare it to.
