			<p>If you clicked on this page, you must be interested in knowing more about me. I'm Kevin Whittaker, a CIT major studying at BYU-Idaho. I changed my major in Fall of 2016 from Languages and International Studies. I was studying German and French (both of which I can speak fairly well). </p> 
			
			<p>I wanted to study CIT because I've always been interested in technology. I always wondered how computers worked, how people create these amazing programs, and what is possible with coding knowledge. Just in these past 6 months I have learned more than I thought I would have. I haven't done incredible things, but it is awesome to see what I can do with the knowledge at this point. It makes me excited to see what more I will be able to do.</p>
