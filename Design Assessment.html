			<h1>Design Principles in Mobile Sites</h1>
			<!-- ***********************************************
Each design principle needs four items:
1- The principle's name and the team member responsible for it.
2- An image (screenshot) of the mobile browser screen showing the design principle in use.
3- The site name used in the picture
4- A discussion of how the design principle is exemplified in the picture. Be detailed!

			<h2>Proximity &mdash; Makenna Gunter</h2> <img src="image1.png" alt="Screen shot illustrating proximity in use">
			<p> roolee.com </p>
			<p> This site uses good proximity because everything is close to eachother but not to close you can tell that things are there own thing! It shows good organization and I think it makes good use of white space throughout the page! </p>
			<h2>Alignment &mdash; Matt Clayson</h2> <img src="" alt="Screen shot illustrating alignment in use">
			<p> starwars.com </p>
			<p> This website uses alignment to create a clean, unified look while also drawing the user's attention to the purpose of the site. That is, in this case, to sell tickets for the movie Rogue One. </p>
			<h2>Repetition &mdash; David Lino</h2> <img src="" alt="Screen shot illustrating repetition in use">
			<p> www.wikipedia.org </p>
			<p> In this website, we are able to find repetition in fonts, in hyperlinks, and in colors. Making use of this principle help us to have a better visualization and understanding of what is showed. For web developers, it helps organize the information they want to share. </p>
			<h2>Contrast &mdash; Ashley Nielson</h2> <img src="" alt="Screen shot illustrating contrast in use">
			<p> https://www.bose.com/en_us/index.html </p>
			<p> What is striking about this website is the contrast of the gray and white background and the dark or more colorful product allows the product to stand out and become the focus or your attention. </p>
			<h2>Typography &mdash; Kevin Whittaker</h2> <img src="" alt="Screen shot illustrating typography in use">
			<p> toms.com </p>
			<p> I like the way that Toms uses their typography to make their mission statement stand out. The "One for One" slogan is written in a different style from everything else. And their font colors usually match the color of the product. </p>
