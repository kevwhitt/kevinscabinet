<h1>Mobile Browsing - Analysis </h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<!-- ***********************************************
Outline what you were asked to do and how well you completed the assignment.
You may want to review the questions you were asked to consider.  If you need more than one paragraph just add another by adding the opening and closing paragraph tags...like this: <p>new paragraph text here</p>
************************************************* -->
<p>I don't browse the internet that much at all, but I was able to find an example of each thing I liked and disliked. Finding these good and bad examples did help me get an idea of what mobile browsing should be. </p>

<h2>Questions to consider:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Can you still see what you want to see?</li>
<li>Can you find what you're looking for?</li>
<li>Can you do what you want to do?</li>
<li>Any frustrations?</li>
<li>Anything work better on the small screen?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Findings</h2>
<!-- for each question give your general experience, and then give a specific example of a site that you though did a good or bad job with this.  Do not use the same site for all examples! -->
<h3>Can you still see what you want to see?</h3>
<p>I didn't really have a problem with anything I saw. There were a few times when ads would clutter the screen, but overall my experience wasn't ruined. WebMD was alright, but between each paragraph or two there was a big ad that took up almost all the screen. It was a little annoying, but overall it didn't stop me.</p>
<h3>Can you find what you're looking for?</h3>
	<p>For most of the sites I used, I had a decent time finding what I wanted. I liked the Toms website because it had the main page with all their special products shown, but the hamburger nav-window had a great layout to navigate to specific products.</p>
<h3>Can you do what you want to do?</h3>
<p>My objectives for each site were pretty basic and straightforward, so I didn't really encounter any problems. IGN has a good mobile site, in my opinion. It's easy to navigate, and each page has a fantastic layout. I had no problem doing what I went there for.</p>
<h3>Any frustrations?</h3>
<p>I'm sure this isn't a surprise, but any link to an article on facebook was a nightmare. Ads, popups, and links to irrelivant articles cluttered the screen and slowed down the loading times. That always has and probably will continue to frustrate me.</p>
<h3>Anything work better on the small screen?</h3>
<p>I actually found that my banking was actually a little easier to navigate on mobile rather than desktop. I use Chase, and the mobile website was actually really nice, and I found links and things easier.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Something surprised me, but didn't at the same time. Mobile viewing is really good nowadays, for the most part. This generation uses their mobile devices more than anything, I think, and I think developers are aware of that. The mobile world is really rising  catching up, considering how recent it is.</p>

<h2>List of sites</h2>
<!-- list out the sites you used as examples above.  The href="" portion is where you will put the URL to the site.  In between the <a></a> is where you will put the clickable text the use will see.  The first link to Google is given as an example...you should change it to one of your links. -->
